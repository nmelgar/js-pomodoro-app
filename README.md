# JavaScript Pomodoro Timer App

As a software engineer dedicated to enhancing user productivity through web applications, I've developed a Pomodoro Timer App using JavaScript. This project serves as a practical exercise in applying core JavaScript concepts to build a functional and user-friendly tool.

This application implements the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The app provides a clean and intuitive interface for users to manage their time effectively. Key features include:

* Start and stop functionality for both work and break intervals.
* Customizable interval lengths to suit individual preferences.
* Tracking of completed work and break sessions.
* Notifications to signal the start and end of intervals, ensuring users stay on track.

My primary purpose in creating this software is to deepen my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities in building interactive web applications, focusing on time management and user interface development.
